# One Node · FLUX.2 [klein]

A ComfyUI custom node that wraps the full FLUX.2 [klein] workflow into a single self-contained UI widget. No graph to build, no spaghetti wires to connect, just one powerful node with everything inside.

> *One Node to rule them all, One Node to find them,*

## Tutorial

The node has been updated since the tutorial was recorded - check the [Changelog](#changelog) for new features.

---

## What it does

The node has 5 modes, switchable with a single click:

**T2I** - standard text to image generation.

**I2I** - good for creating variations or gently nudging an image in a different direction.

**EDIT** - load one or two reference images and describe the change.

**PAINT** - three tools in one:
- Sketch: a full canvas with layers, brushes, shapes and more. Draw something and generate from it.
- Inpaint: paint a mask over the area you want to change, write what should be there instead.
- Outpaint: expand the image in any direction by dragging the edges.

**FACESWAP** - swap a face from a source image onto a target. Requires a Faceswap LoRA.

---

## Installation

Clone this repo into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/yanokusnir-ai/one-node-flux-2-klein.git
```

You need one additional custom node for inpaint and outpaint modes:
[ComfyUI-Inpaint-CropAndStitch](https://github.com/lquesada/ComfyUI-Inpaint-CropAndStitch) by lquesada. Just clone it into the same folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/lquesada/ComfyUI-Inpaint-CropAndStitch.git
```

Restart ComfyUI. The node appears as **One Node · FLUX.2 [klein]**.

## Models

This node works with any FLUX.2 [klein] model officially released by Black Forest Labs.

You will find all officially released FLUX.2 [klein] models on the [Black Forest Labs HuggingFace page](https://huggingface.co/collections/black-forest-labs/flux2). Pick the variant that fits your VRAM and use case. You will need a diffusion model, a matching text encoder, and the VAE.

The Faceswap LoRA is required for the Faceswap mode. The BiRefNet model is optional, only needed for the Remove Background feature in PAINT mode.

- Added fullscreen mode - hit the expand button in the Sketch toolbar to go fullscreen.
- Brush size limit increased from 200 to 500px.
- Added aspect ratio lock button next to the canvas size inputs.

**Gallery right-click**
Right-clicking any thumbnail in the gallery grid now shows a quick "Use as..." context menu.
